# Wireframe & Justification

This document should help you explain how your user interfaces are designed. You should have a wireframe to give a good overview and some screenshot with simple writeups to justify your designs. 


## wireframe

Draft 1 of data viewer wireframe, will be changed as we go along the project to implement better features and styling.
Draft 1 is a prototype to be improved on. It consist of all required features as such.
Draft 1 is designed on 13/5/2020 
basic features inspired by data.gov dataset website and sp blackboard lesson website, basic styling, basic features even though incomplete, which will be improved later on.

Draft 2  of data viewer wireframe - added features such as sorting, new design and layout! also i redid the column tables as i feel that this will be more oranised. Designs include black and light colours to show contrast!( inspired by justification)

Draft 2 is designed on 17/5/2020 
Draft 2 is improved dramatically from draft 1, featuring styling, navbar, footer, new table layout, filter, sorting!. inspired by all the 3 websites used for justifications, combining all the good things about what i feel about the websites. it is design as such, as i really like the UI of the websites, and i decide to integrate it with my creativity.

Draft 3 of data viewer will be uploaded on 19/5/2020 - will feature new columns(start and end time of lecutres),filters~!

Draft 3 is desgined on 20/5/2020.
final version of the wireframe, full featured and designed. Design is based on improvements on previous draft, which draws inspiration from the justifications to design,(for example, the black and light/bright colour contrast is used to designed parts of the website(navbar and footer being dark and background being light to bring out the table, giving it a warm feel and stands out)




### justification 1
Below is the list of examples from websites i drew my inspirations to design the wireframe.

#### good points
1) data is clear and concise: easy to find the relevent charts and data regarding certain coins.
2) Design gives u a professional look(with the use of logos,and green and red colours for certain data), clean and slick
3) User interface is easy to use(all the relevant information and buttons can be found easily)
4) Good colour contrast, using black as the background and using contrast colours(white, red , green) to see the data and charts easier.
5) Pagination tool meets requirement

#### bad points
1) Font size inappropriate and small
2) need a search bar
3) need more filters(sort out different coins)

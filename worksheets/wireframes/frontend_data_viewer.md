This document should help you explain how your user interfaces are designed. You should have a wireframe to give a good overview and some screenshot with simple writeups to justify your designs.

#### good points
1) data is clear and concise: easy to find the relevent charts and data regarding certain coins.
2) Design gives u a professional look(with the use of logos,and green and red colours for certain data), clean and slick
3) User interface is easy to use(all the relevant information and buttons can be found easily)
4) Good colour contrast, using black as the background and using contrast colours(white, red , green) to see the data and charts easier.
5) Pagination tool meets requirement

#### bad points
1) Font size inappropriate and small
2) need a search bar
3) need more filters(sort out different coins)

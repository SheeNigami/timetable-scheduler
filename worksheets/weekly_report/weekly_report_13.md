# Weekly Report

This report is for you to document the progres of your project. You should also document any change in plan, e.g. change in design or change in API specification or change in work allocation. The following is a template for you to follow.

## What have I done last week

- Got the Basic Result Viewer to work.

## What do I plan to do next week

- Finish the Advanced algorithm with the Get Advance Result endpoint.
- Integrate it with the Frontend.

## Additional Thoughts

- Getting the Hall no. to display in the frontend was tricker than expected, especially as there was no hallNo in the response. (I had to add the hall no. to the response in the frontend myself before drawing the datatable).

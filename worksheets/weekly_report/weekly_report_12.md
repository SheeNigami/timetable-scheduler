# Weekly Report

This report is for you to document the progres of your project. You should also document any change in plan, e.g. change in design or change in API specification or change in work allocation. The following is a template for you to follow.

## What have I done last week

- Finished the basic algorithm along with the basic result endpoint.
- Tested the algorithm/endpoint using the backend test runner, all tests were passed!

## What do I plan to do next week

- Integrate the get basic result endpoint to the frontend

## Additional Thoughts

- Thinking and drafting up algorithms (and eventually coding them) is an extremely cool and rewarding process.kj

# Weekly Report

This report is for you to document the progres of your project. You should also document any change in plan, e.g. change in design or change in API specification or change in work allocation. The following is a template for you to follow.

## What have I done last week

- Made the Basic Frontend templates for the 3 other pages with filler data

## What do I plan to do next week

- Create the new table required along with the documentations

## Additional Thoughts

- HTML/Javascript is still the simplest

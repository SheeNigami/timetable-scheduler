# Weekly Report

This report is for you to document the progres of your project. You should also document any change in plan, e.g. change in design or change in API specification or change in work allocation. The following is a template for you to follow.

## What have I done last week

- Finished the advanced algorithm with the Get Advance Result endpoint. Tested with the backend test runner, all tests passed!
- Integrated the endpoint into the frontend to be able to compute result.

## What do I plan to do next week

- Host the backend and frontend on heroku and github pages respectively.

## Additional Thoughts

- The Advanced algorithm was pretty hard to come up with, I had to ask the lecturer for help in order to draft up the algorithm and eventually code it.
- Finally managed to pass all the tests in the backend test runner!

# Weekly Report

This report is for you to document the progres of your project. You should also document any change in plan, e.g. change in design or change in API specification or change in work allocation. The following is a template for you to follow.

## What have I done last week

- Hosted Backend on Heroku
- Hosted Frontend on Github Pages
- Made sure that the frontend and backend could communicate properly with one another.

## What do I plan to do next week

- Make slides and prepare for the presentation/demo.

## Additional Thoughts

- We still have to watch out for CORS policies and getting the correct endpoints after hosting our frontend/backend to ensure that they are communicating with one another properly without any issues.
- Being able to host a website for free on the internet is amazing!
